  <h3 style="color:midnightblue"><b>Daydream 1</b></h3>
  <p style="color:white;background-color: midnightblue;border:2px solid plum;padding:10px">During my daydreaming, I was thinking about the projects I worked on in college. I recall my room being the major location where I worked on school tasks. Most of my coursework is done on my bed, which is also where I sit for class or at my desk. During Drawing Studio, I moved my workstation closer to the curtains so that I can view my television while working or drawing still lifes. While drawing, I do a lot of watching. I remembered some of my greatest creations, such as The Reminiscence of Video Games, a poster on my wall, and a book I made for my Design Practices class. Surface Research color scheme posters It was a great effort to acquire materials of various hues and opacity and compare the ranges. My most recent drawings are some of my faves from my month-long Printmaking workshop. It was timely, but once completed, it was fulfilling. I battled a lot with the Newport Jazz Festival poster because the positioning of components felt incorrect in certain areas and I kept playing with the color scheme. I also recall having to obtain the poster from Poster Ninja because the Go Lab had closed before I completed, but thankfully I got the poster on time and I enjoyed it overall, despite how difficult it was to create. The majority of the digital projects I generated were done in my room, generally while sitting or resting on my bed. The bed allowed me to focus on pressing work such as an animated video of the March on Washington for Time Studio, a restaurant menu for Web Design, and a 250-page book printed for Core Studio ll. Overall, my bedroom serves as both a creative environment for developing and designing projects and a relaxing space for me to unwind. Even though my room is a little disorganized, it still seems like home to me.

      <h3 style="color:mistyrose;"><b>Daydream 2</b></h3>
      <p style="color:purple;background-color: mistyrose;border:2px solid palegreen;padding:10px">I was fantasizing about a variety of topics, including what I wanted to accomplish in the future, the meaning of the many items in my room, my favorite games on my PlayStation, and the items stored in my bins and closets.

In the future, I wondered if I would still be the same person I am now if I had the same attitude, mindset, and desire for diverse relationships. Would I have my desired career (Graphic Designer) today, would I be happy, and who will be with me in the future?

Some elements, such as my pink heart/yellow moon, my light, the usage of flowers in my artwork, and the photos hanging above, have symbolic meanings. The pink heart/yellow room reminds me of when I was small and wanted the light on when I was terrified or wanted to see something.  When I do schoolwork late at night or want to browse the web on my laptop, I utilize my room light. Flowers are among my favorite components in my artwork since they are easy and enjoyable to draw and because there are so many different sorts of flowers. The images in my room represent the various sorts of art I've done and the stylistic differences between them. Some of the artworks on display range from elementary school (grasshopper art), middle school (filter art), high school (purple backdrop with various colored flowers), and college (glyph, printmaking, video game, jazz, etc. posters). I was also thinking of the chalkboard on my wall, which had the same things on it for many years, such as "Mommy was here, suckachump." My laptop, which I use for studying and occasionally for gaming.

My video game poster beneath my television reminded me of my PlayStation 4 video games and my favorite games. I was thinking about one of my favorite games, “Detroit Becomes Human,” and the fantastic plot and enjoyment I had with it. “Dragon Dogma,” with its enjoyable character creation and quests/combat. The gameplay, story, and aesthetics of “Uncharted 4: A Thief's End”

I have my old elementary school paintings, homework, and notebooks in my storage and boxes. These artifacts remind me of my youth. I recall scribbling notes and stories in my journal. I also stored my previously used items in case I needed to utilize them again.

    <h3 style="color:orange"><b>Daydream 3</b></h3>
    <p style="color:purple;background-color: orange;border:2px solid orange;padding:10px">I was reminiscing about the travels I had taken and the fear I was having. I mainly was thinking about the excursions to Philadelphia, Louisiana, and the wax museums. Likewise, I was thinking about the trip to Philadelphia that included Dave and Busters and a trip to the mall. The vacation was primarily for my mother because she needed to travel out of state and wanted to bring us with her. The games were enjoyable, and the food was great. In 2013, my grandpa died in Louisiana, and my entire family traveled there to mourn him and say our final goodbyes. I recall going to Laser Tag, seeing my cousins do donuts in the parking lot, and sobbing a lot about my grandfather. Meteor Man and Little Man were two of his favorite movies, and seeing them now makes me think about him. When my mother took my boys and me to my grandfather's house, I used to see him. I've been to the wax museum a few times in my life, the most recent being in 2020. I recall snapping photographs with the wax figures, going to a 3D movie where I had to wear 3D glasses, and getting doused with water at various moments. Another vacation I was pondering was IFly, which I recall struggling with when it came to flying up and staying on the ground. I thought I'd be cool with trying it once, but I don't like it. My nightmares were centered on vehicle accidents and the fear of being alone. I'm frightened of being alone at home now that my parents and brother are out of town for a game in Miami. Despite having security cameras and alarms installed in my house, I am still anxious about the unknown.

  <p style="color:darkslategrey;background-color: papayawhip;border:2px solid pink;padding:10px">In this fantasy, I fantasized about my ideal home. My ideal home has four to five bedrooms, one of which can be converted into a business office. Three bathrooms, one of which is large and has a toilet and basin. The house's color palette will be gray/black, with granite countertops in the kitchen and bar sections with chairs overlooking the counters. I'd like my house to incorporate the various designs I've created throughout my life. I'd want to have a few televisions in various rooms, some of which have gaming consoles. In addition, I may build a one-car garage and a driveway for my automobiles. My residence would want to be a reflection of both my and my partner's interests. My house's outside would be black, with a light gray roof and a dark gray entrance.

      <p style="color:antiquewhite;background-color: darkred;border:2px solid darkcyan;padding:10px">In my daydream. I fantasized about having the ability to fly. I imagine myself with flying abilities, allowing me to see things I've never seen before, not having to deal with terrible travel, and being able to fly with birds or planes. Likewise, I want to go to places I've never been before and see and touch things I've never seen or touched before. I'd like to see how far I could go and what would happen if everyone has abilities. Would climate change be mitigated, and how much would we continue to rely on forms of transportation such as automobiles, buses, trains, and so on? Would we wear capes, and would this limit our ability to fly? Is it possible for people to touch the clouds, and if so, how fluffy are they?

Likewise, I remember eating chicken tenders, ham biscuits, and shrimp. Moe's Southwest Grill's tacos and nachos will be served over the approaching Christmas season.

I was dreaming of the sorts of animals I would like to possess, such as turtles and fishes, as well as dogs, which are commonly known as a companion or an animal that loves. The bear was represented as kind and not dangerous. Finally, there's the pig, who enjoys getting muddy but is otherwise a pleasant animal.

<p style="color:beige;background-color: teal;border:2px solid darkblue;padding:10px">In this daydream, I see using activities to assist someone distressed. Talking with them about the problem, bringing them pizza, writing or sketching out their feelings, and watching television were some of the suggestions I had. I imagined that the pizzas we'd order would be a combination of pepperoni and other components. A pencil would be used for writing or sketching. Many television shows may be modified to assist people to ease tension.2
